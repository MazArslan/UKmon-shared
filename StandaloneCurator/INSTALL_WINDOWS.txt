INTRODUCTION & PREREQUISITES
===============================
This programme will curate UFOcapture data, moving 'bad' data to a separate folder.

0. INSTALL PYTHON 
=================
You will need Python 3.x installed. On Windows 10 this is simple: open the Microsoft store,
search for Python and install the latest 3.x version (currently 3.9). On earlier versions of
windows, go to www.python.org and find a suitable download.

1. CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT (Optional)
==========================================
Python best-practice is to create a dedicated virtual environment for ufoCurator. If you don't know
what this means you can skip this step. However if you've previously used Python it will 
probably make sense to you. Once you've made the environment, you'll need to activate it before
using the programme. 

2. INSTALL THE SOFTWARE
=======================
In your home directory or other location of your choice, create a folder "ufoCurator" to contain 
the programme and expand the zip file into into it. 
You should have a structure like this in the new folder
    curate.ps1
    CurateUFO.py
    curation.ini
    requirements.txt
    UFOHandler/ReadUFOCapXML.py
    UFOHandler/ReadUFOAnalyserXML.py
    CameraCurator/curateCamera.py
    CameraCurator/curateEngine.py
    CameraCurator/curateFolder.py

3. TEST
=======
- Open Powershell and change directory to the ufoCurator folder.
- Activate the virtual environment, if you created one.
- type
        .\curate.ps1 

This will check that all necessary python libraries are installed, and then run the programme and
display the help information.

Now read USAGE.txt to see how to use the  programme.
