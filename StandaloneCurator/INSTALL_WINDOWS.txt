INTRODUCTION & PREREQUISITES
===============================
This programme will curate UFOcapture data, moving 'bad' data to a separate folder.

0. INSTALL PYTHON 
=================
You will need Python 3.x installed. On Windows 10 this is simple: open the Microsoft store,
search for Python and install the latest 3.x version (currently 3.9). On earlier versions of
windows, go to www.python.org and find a suitable download.

1. CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
============================================
Python best-practice is to create a dedicated virtual environment for ufoCurator. 
Its not ESSENTIAL to do this, but strongly recommended as it helps keep each Python app
in its own 'bubble'. 
To create a virtual environment, open a Powershell prompt then type: 
cd ~
pip install virtualenv
python -m virtualenv ufoCurator

2. INSTALL THE SOFTWARE
=======================
In your home directory or other location of your choice, create a folder "ufoCurator" (this folder
will already exist if you created a virtual environment). Expand the zip file into into this folder. 
You should have a structure like this:
    curate.ps1
    CurateUFO.py
    curation.ini
    requirements.txt
    UFOHandler/ReadUFOCapXML.py
    UFOHandler/ReadUFOAnalyserXML.py
    CameraCurator/curateCamera.py
    CameraCurator/curateEngine.py
    CameraCurator/curateFolder.py

3. TEST
=======
- Open Powershell and change directory to the ufoCurator folder.
- type
        cd ~\ufoCurator
        .\curate.ps1 

This will activate your virtual environment, if used, then check that all necessary Python 
libraries are installed, before runing the programme and displaying the help information.

Now read USAGE.txt to see how to use the  programme.
