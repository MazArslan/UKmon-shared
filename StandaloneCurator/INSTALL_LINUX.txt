INTRODUCTION & PREREQUISITES
===============================
This programme will curate UFOcapture data, moving 'bad' data to a separate folder.

0. INSTALL PYTHON 3
===================
Use your distro's normal mechanism to install Python3, pip3 and virtualenv. 

1. CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
===============================
Create a virtual environment called "ufoCurator" and activate it

2. INSTALL SOFTWARE
===================
In your home directory or other location of your choice, create a folder "ufoCurator" to contain 
the programme and expand the zip file into into it. 
You should have a structure like this in the new folder
    curate.sh
    CurateUFO.py
    curation.ini
    requirements.txt
    UFOHandler/ReadUFOCapXML.py
    UFOHandler/ReadUFOAnalyserXML.py
    CameraCurator/curateCamera.py
    CameraCurator/curateEngine.py
    CameraCurator/curateFolder.py

3. TEST
=======
- Open a command prompt or terminal window on the ufoCurator folder.
- Activate the virtual environment.
- make the script executable
        chmod +x ./curate.sh
- then run it
        ./curate.sh 

This will check that all necessary python libraries are installed, and then run the programme and
display the help information.

Now read USAGE.txt to see how to use the  programme.
