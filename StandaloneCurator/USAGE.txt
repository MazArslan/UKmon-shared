TO USE THE PROGRAMME
====================
Open a Windows powershell window or Linux/MacOS terminal window on the ufoCurator folder.
Activate the virtual environment, if you created one.

Run the programme - for MacOS or Linux: 
    ./curate.sh /path/to/your/data
or for Windows:
    .\curate.ps1 c:\path\to\your\data

Where /path/to/your/data is the location of a folder containing your uncurated UFO files, 
for example c:\meteordata


SHORTCUTS
=========
I recommend that while testing your installation, you do so in a powershell or terminal window
as explained above. This will allow you to see any error messages 
Once you have confirmed its working correctly, you can create a desktop shortcut. Just remember to include
the path to the data, for example your shortcut command might read
c:\users\fred\ufoCurator\curate.ps1 c:/ufo/2020
or 
~/ufoCurator/curate.sh ~/meteordata/2020

WHAT IT DOES
============
The programme will classify your data and move bad data to a 'bad' folder in /path/to/your/data, 
displaying its progress and rationale onscreen.
It will also create a logfile in the same folder that indicates why it classified each file. 

CONFIGURATION
=============
The programme reads various parmeters from the configuration file:

MAXRMS - maximum deviation from a straight line before an event is rejected. 
Note that this is overriden by MAXBRI, to allow for fireballs with curved paths. 

MAXBRI - maximum brightness before an event is ALWAYS included. Prevents rejection of fireballs 
at the expense of including things like lightning flashes, fireworks and bright clouds.

MAXLEN - maximum number of frames a track can traverse before its rejected. UFO cameras operate at 50fps
interleaved, so the default max of 100 corresponds to two seconds. Thats a slow meteor or more likely a plane. 
MINLEN - lower threshold below which data is rejected as unreliable (position errors too large). 

MAXOBJS - maximum number of objects per frame. If you have more than 15 objects in a single frame
then its almost always  clouds, aircraft or wildlife.

MOVEFILES - set movefiles to False if you DO NOT want to actually move bad data. 

USEFOLDERS - Set usefolders to False if you dont want the programme to sort bad data by type

LOCALFOLDER and BADFOLDER - not used in the mode described above.
