<h1>Summary Report for __SHWR__, __YEAR__</h1>
<h2>UKMON</h2>
<h3>Report Created: __REPDATE__</h3>
<h2>Summary of Activity for __SHWR__</h2><br>
<p>In __YEAR__ a total of __CAMCOUNT__ cameras contributed data to the UKMON repository. 
Together, these cameras recorded __METCOUNT__ individual meteor observations for __SHWR__. 
The number of recorded observations by station is as follows:</p><br>

<br>
<p>After applying quality criteria`we found that __PAIRS__ meteors were observed by more than one camera
(Unified observations). The following shows a count of the number of meters observed by two, three, etc. 
cameras.</p><br>

<br>
<p>The number of unified observations as a percentage of individual observations is __UNIFRAC__&percnt;. </p>
<br><br>
<h2>Fireball Ativity</h2>
<p>A total of __FBCOUNT__ fireballs were observed in the reporting period.
    Here we define a fireball as a meteor event with a magnitude of -4 or less.</p>

<h2>Velocity Distribution</h2>
<p>The following graphs show the distribution of velocities</p>

<h2>Magnitudes</h2>
<p>The following graphs show the distribution of magnitudes:</p>

<p>The following plots shows the altitude of the atart and end of ablation for each individual meteor. 
    The plot is in order of decreasing start height and gives a good visualisation of the depth 
    of the ablation zone. Where in the atmosphere ablation occurs will depend on factors 
    such as meteor velocity and composition.

<p>The maximum observed altitude was __MAXALT__ km and the minimum observed altitude was __MINALT__ km. 
    The distribution of distances travelled through the ablation zone was as follows:</p>
