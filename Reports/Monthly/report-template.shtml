<h1>Summary report __YEAR__</h1>
<h2>UKMON</h2>
<h3>Report Created: __REPDATE__</h3>
<h2>Summary of Activity for __YEAR__</h2><br>
<p>A total of __CAMCOUNT__ cameras recorded __METCOUNT__ individual meteor observations and 
    __PAIRS__ meteors were observed by more than one camera (Unified observations). 
    A breakdown of unified observation counts by stream (top ten) is and where possible these 
    were further analysed to determine the orbit and other details of the meteoroid.
    The number of unified observations as a percentage of individual observations is __UNIFRAC__&percnt;.

<h2>Fireball Activity and Magnitudes</h2>
<p>A total of __FBCOUNT__ fireballs were observed in the reporting period.
    A fireball is defined as a meteor event with an absolute magnitude of -4 or less. 
    A breakdown by month and by shower is shown below. </p>

<p>The brightest fireballs observed during __YEAR__ were:</p>

    Also shown is the absolute magnitude distribution and the variation of magnitude with start and end altitide. There is 
    usually a correlation between these, as small faint meteors will tend to become visible 
    lower and burn up at a higher altitude, whereas conversely large meteors will become visible
    sooner and may last longer. A straight line fit through the two sets of data 
    will thus often show a convergence towards the right of the graph.

<h2>Velocity Distribution</h2>
The following graphs show the distribution of observed and heliocentric velocity
in the in the unified data. Observed velocity is the velocity as measured
from the observer's location. Heliocentric velocity is the true velocity of the meteoroid
around the Sun. There can be an appreciable difference between these values due to the 
velocity of the Earth along its orbit and of the observer they rotate with the Earth.

<h2>Altitude and Distance</h2>
<p>The following plots shows the distribution of ground distance travelled 
    and the altitude of the start and end of ablation for each individual meteor. 
    Ground distance is the linear distance from the first to the last observed point. 
    The ablation plot gives a visualisation of the vertical distance over which the meteor
    ablated or burned up. The height at which this occurs will depend on factors 
    such as meteor size, velocity and composition.
    The maximum observed altitude was __MAXALT__ km and the minimum observed altitude was __MINALT__ km.

<h2> Orbital Analysis</h2>
<p>
    Trajectory and orbit analysis was performed for unified events. The charts below show the distribution 
    of semimajor axis amongst the unified events. Some showers show pronounced clustering of semimajor axis
    due to gravitational resonances particularly with Jupiter. Extremely large values are also possible
    and often indicate that the meteoroid has been severely perturbed by close passage near a planet. 
    <br>
    Also shown is the position of the apparent radiant of each unified event. These should (obviously)
    cluster round the radiant of the shower but its normal for shower meteors to be a few degrees 
    away from this, though its important to remember that for most showers, the radiant moves
    location each night due to the Earths movement through the debris stream.
    The matching process uses distance from the expected radiant to filter
    candidate events.
