<h2>Summary of Activity for __SHWR__</h2>
<p>
    In __YEAR__, __CAMCOUNT__ cameras recorded __METCOUNT__ individual meteor observations
    identified as __SHWR__. This included __PAIRS__ unified events, meteors observed by more than one camera.
    The number of unified observations as a percentage of individual observations was __UNIFRAC__&percnt;.
</p>
<p>
    The graphs below show some statistics relating to the individual observations and unified
    data. The first two show the number of observations by station and by time. The third shows the
    number of unified events, sorted by the number of cameras that detected each event.

<h2>Fireball Activity and Magnitude Analysis</h2>
<p>
    The first graph below shows the distribution of absolute magnitude.
    Each meteor shower tends to have a unique distribution of magnitudes.
    A shower with a high ZHR but mostly faint meteors will seem poor visually
    though radio detectors may show many more events as they are more sensitive.
    On the other hand a shower with mostly bright events may look spectacular but
    have an overall low ZHR. We therefore assign each shower a Population Index
    which is a measure of the average magnitude. For these data, the Population index was
    __POPINDEX__.
    <br>
    A total of __FBCOUNT__ fireballs were observed in the reporting period, defining a fireball
    as a meteor event with an absolute magnitude of -4 or less. Details of the fireballs
    are shown in the table below.
    <br>
    Also of interest is the variation of magnitude with start and end altitide. There is
    usually a correlation between these factors, as small faint meteors will tend to become visible
    lower and burn up at a higher altitude, whereas conversely large meteors will become visible
    sooner and may last longer. A straight line fit through the two sets of data
    will thus often show a convergence towards the right of the graph.

<h2>Velocity Distribution</h2>
<p>
    The following graphs show the distribution of observed and heliocentric velocity
    in the in the unified data. Observed velocity is the velocity as measured
    from the observer's location. Heliocentric velocity is the true velocity of the meteoroid
    around the Sun. There can be an appreciable difference between these values due to the
    velocity of the Earth along its orbit and of the observer they rotate with the Earth.

<h2>Altitude and Distance</h2>
<p>The following plots shows the distribution of ground distance travelled
    and the altitude of the start and end of ablation for each individual meteor.
    Ground distance is the linear distance from the first to the last observed point.
    The ablation plot gives a visualisation of the vertical distance over which the meteor
    ablated or burned up. The height at which this occurs will depend on factors
    such as meteor size, velocity and composition.
    The maximum observed altitude was __MAXALT__ km and the minimum observed altitude was __MINALT__ km.

<h2> Orbital Analysis</h2>
<p>
    Trajectory and orbit analysis was performed for unified events. The charts below show the distribution
    of semimajor axis amongst the unified events. Some showers show pronounced clustering of semimajor axis
    due to gravitational resonances particularly with Jupiter. Extremely large values are also possible
    and often indicate that the meteoroid has been severely perturbed by close passage near a planet.
    <br>
    Also shown is the position of the apparent radiant of each unified event. These should (obviously)
    cluster round the radiant of the shower but its normal for shower meteors to be a few degrees
    away from this, though its important to remember that for most showers, the radiant moves
    location each night due to the Earths movement through the debris stream.
    Note that the matching process uses distance from the expected radiant to filter
    candidate events.
