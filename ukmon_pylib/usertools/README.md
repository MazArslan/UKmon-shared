A bunch of scripts that are intended to be used by humans to do interesting stuff.

* drawFTPFile.py - draws a simple line diagram of the detections in an FTP file. Handy for checking for bad masks.
* findNearDuplicates - searches a year's worth of data for possible duplicate trajectories
* getLiveImages - retrieves the live stream data for a specific date/time 
* getOverlappingFovs - identifies overlapping cameras
* retrieveECSV - retrieve an ECSV from the database. 
* plotTrack - plot various graphs from a CSV file of x,y,h,t
* toKML - converts a pickle file or a CSV of x,y,h,t data into a 3-D KML viewable on Google Maps
