        <p><em>Last reviewed 2023-03-15</em></p>
        <p>This page explains how we handle any personal and sensitive data that we collect. </p>
        <hr>
        <b>Camera ID, name and geographic location of each camera.</b>
        <p>
            We collect the Camera ID, general location name and precise geographic coordinates
            of each camera for the following purposes:

            <li>For Scientific data analysis such as statistical reporting of showers, orbit and trajectory
                calculations of meteors detected by the camera. The results of this analysis are made available
                on the UK Meteor Network Archive website.
            </li>
            <li>
                To exchange data with researchers, other dection networks and the interested public
                as part of our commitment to an open data policy, and in particular to help identify
                the location of any possible meteorite falls. The downloadable data are made available
                on the UK Meteor Network Archive website.
            </li>
            <li>
                Camera ID and general location may also be used in publications and papers, where relevant
                and pertinent to the subject matter of the paper.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, we might collect Camera ID UK1234, location name Sunthorp*, geographic coordinates
            53.62501N 0.08567E, altitude -20m. If a paper is published which makes use of data from this
            camera, the author might mention the camera ID and approximate location in the paper.

            If you have asked us to build a camera for you, the camera builder will also ask for

            * Sunthorp is a lost village in the Humber Estuary. It was recorded in the Domesday Book
            but was washed away in about 1350 according to an account in the Chronicles of Meaux. It does not host a camera!
