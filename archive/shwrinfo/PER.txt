The Perseids are generally regarded as the meteor hunter's favorite, partly because of
their summertime appearance. Although the Geminids usually outperform them, the more 
clement summer weather means more people tend to be out observing. 
This shower is rich in bright, persistent meteors though they're fast moving. 
The radiant is circumpolar so this is another northen-hemisphere-only shower.
Best visual rates are before dawn when the radiant is high, but Perseids can be seen 
all night if the skies are clear.
