Notes<br>
<li> The data are sometimes 'lumpy' because from time to time, we have to manually reprocess
    late or updated data. Depending on volume and complexity, this can be costly.
</li>
<li>So for example during July, May/June data from Clanfield were recieved and processed.</li>
<li>Costs are currently roughly equally split between raw compute, container services and storage.</li>
<li>
However, some storage costs are not yet included as they're in a separate AWS account.
