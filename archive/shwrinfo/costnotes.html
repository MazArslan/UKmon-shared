Notes<br>
<li> Costs in account #1 are largely storage. These costs are fairly static, though they're growing slowly. 

</li>
<li>Costs in account #2 are a mixture of storage and compute. The compute costs vary from day to day, 
    as they depend on data volumes. During busy showers the daily cost may rise to $20 for a few days.
</li>
<li>Costs are constantly being optimised. During November 2022, an optimisation reduced the cost of storage
    by more than fifty percent.
