Notes<br>
<li> The data are sometimes 'lumpy' because from time to time, we have to manually reprocess
    late or updated data. Depending on volume and complexity, this can be costly.
</li>
<li>So for example during July, the May/June data from Clanfield were recieved. Processing 
    data that arrives later entails reprocessing the entire period to make sure nothing was
    missed that could have matched the new data. 
</li>
<li>Costs are currently roughly equally split between raw compute, container services and storage.</li>
