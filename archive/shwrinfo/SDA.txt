One of several summer showers with low radiants for northern observers.
Can be differentiated from the Capricornids by their faster speed. 
This shower also produces a high number of faint meteors, often strongly
detected by radio detectors, indeed in radio they often outperform the Perseids. 
Radiant on the border between Aquarius and Pisces. It rises just before dawn 
so this is visually a difficult shower.
